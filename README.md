# Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability

## Overview

This repository contains implementations for Randomized Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining algorithms, as well as the necessary scripts for analyzing their performance. The assignment explores the efficiency and scalability of these algorithms through theoretical analysis and empirical comparison.

## Code Files

1. **randomized_quicksort.py**: Implementation of the Randomized Quicksort algorithm.
2. **deterministic_quicksort.py**: Implementation of the Deterministic Quicksort algorithm (using the first element as pivot).
3. **hash_table_chaining.py**: Implementation of a hash table using chaining for collision resolution.

## How to Run

1. **Randomized Quicksort**:
   - Run `randomized_quicksort.py` to see the implementation of Randomized Quicksort.
   - Usage example is provided in the `__main__` block.

   ```bash
   python randomized_quicksort.py
